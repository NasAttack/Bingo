I implimented a 4-D array variable so the first array represented the player the 
following two was for the 2-D board and the last array reprensented the board if it had bingo or not
with that I also used a boolean to notify the program that a person achieved bingo and output who 
that person was. In this lab I didnt use any functions I used a lot of nested for loops with if statements.
The specific name for the input file that my code reads is Input1.txt
